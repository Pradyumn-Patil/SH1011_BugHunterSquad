this projects contains sample visualizations for multi-hazard visualization as per location selected by individual.

## Problem statement 
Disaster is one of the most devastating disruptions of life that is caused by nature or man-made situations. The phenomena that may occur are floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons, etc. These may happen around the world and necessary precautionary measures should be taken into considerations for humans to survive and have a sustainable life.
Region-wise repository and visualization is needed, such that, if a person selects a particular area, they are able to know what kind of disasters, calamities etc. that region is prone to.
This helps in selection of types of houses to be built in a particular area with the necessary precautions.

## Description:
The idea is to develop and design an information system that will assist in the disaster management process easier. 
We would be basically building a web application using multiple Google Maps API (based on requirements), so that the user can search for a specific region and get all the information that they require, which would be curated by us.
Specifically, it will accomplish the following objectives: to visualize various data in resource allocations such as evacuation mapping and management using data analytics.
The utilization of DSS concepts such as data analytics and visualization increases productivity and venue for technological advancement, especially in disaster management. 

## Abstract/Summary:
The impact of the calamities can be visualized and generated map reports for future references in multiple application scenarios.
The system can notify all stakeholders, especially the areas with a high risk of casualties.
It can determine if the population from affected areas on a certain timeline cannot be accommodated anymore in the existing area/region.
A complete detailed visualization of the areas will be provided, with proper color-coding based on the map legend, and according to the timeline, with proper chronology maintained every year.
GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on the JSON format. It makes it possible to visualise and highlight calamities affected areas like landslides etc.
Our system provides a unique solution by specifically displaying all necessary information regarding climate, disaster history, topography, areas in proximity etc., of the region selected by the user. 
We would also be employing data-driven machine learning tools and models to suggest the types of houses to be built in an area based on the topography of that particular area.
Based on the soil type, history of natural calamities and topography of a region, a recommendation system will be developed for recommending suitable, region-specific houses with the help of Machine Learning algorithms and techniques (like Collaborative Filtering etc.). 
The visualization tools to be employed are very intuitive, and not just bland statistical data, making use of D3.js and Deck.gl to make the data interactive and easy to understand and access for the user.
Currently, an interactive visualization solution doesnâ€™t exist, which we would be providing with the help of our web-application.
