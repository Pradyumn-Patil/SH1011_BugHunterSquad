## Problem statement 
Disaster is one of the most devastating disruptions of life that is caused by nature or man-made situations. The phenomena that may occur are floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons, etc. These may happen around the world and necessary precautionary measures should be taken into considerations for humans to survive and have a sustainable life.
Region-wise repository and visualization is needed, such that, if a person selects a particular area, they are able to know what kind of disasters, calamities etc. that region is prone to.
This helps in selection of types of houses to be built in a particular area with the necessary precautions.
